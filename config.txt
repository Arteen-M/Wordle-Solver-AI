This file takes the first two lines and determines which word set and which parameters to use.
It ignores any other lines.

On the first line, "short" indicates to use the short list of words (~2000 words), "long" indicates to use
the long list of words (~15000 words) and anything else indicates to use the test set of words (~6000 words).
The test set was the original set of words used to test the program.

The second line indicates which parameters to use. "speed" indicates to use the parameters designed for speed, and
"avg" (or any other input) indicates to use the parameters for average.
